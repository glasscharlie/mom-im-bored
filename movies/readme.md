* In this project, we create a website titled "MOM-I'M-BORED!!" with the purpose of entertaining the users when they are bored. We provide a wide selection of movies to watch as an indoor activity and track locations as an outdoor activity. Boredom can seem unavoidable. This is especially true right now, when many of us are trapped indoors owing to the social distancing efforts required to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Some people have children to keep them occupied, while others are working even harder during this crisis. Others are trapped inside, staring at the same walls they've been staring at for days, possibly alone, and feeling as if nothing can help them get out of their rut.

* Our project consists of 3 CSS files, 3 html files, and 2 JavaScript files. The CSS and html files are for the main page, the movies website, and the trails website. The 2 other JavaScript files are for the trails and movies website.

# main page
* Our website composes of the main page, which gives an introduction to the audience for the website, and has 2 buttons, one for the "Movies" and the other one for "Tracks". Each button will lead the audience to another website.

# trails
* The trails website composes of a "home" button which returns the users to the main page, an input button which users can type in which city they're in, and a search button for when the users want to see the locations and map of the tracks. (See pictures "trails-home.png" and "trails-search.png)

# movies
* The movies website consists of a search box, where users can input the movie they want to watch. After hitting the search button, the website will give details of the movie, such as the actors, awards, box office, and a few other information. At the bottom of the page is a link to the trailer of the movie, and also the wallpaper of the movie. Next to the search button is a "Random Movie" button which takes a random movie from the API and displays it in the website. Each time the user clicks on the button it will display different random movies. (See pictures "movies-home.png" and "movies-search.png")
