        <h3>
            Boredom can seem unavoidable. This is especially true right now, when many of us 
            are trapped indoors owing to the social distancing efforts required to prevent the 
            spread of COVID-19. Some people have children to keep them occupied, while others 
            are working even harder during this crisis. Others are trapped inside, staring at 
            the same walls they've been staring at for days, possibly alone, and feeling as 
            if nothing can help them get out of their rut.

            In this page, we offer trails as an outdoor activity, and movies when you want to 
            spend your time at home. There are a few reasons why trails/hiking can be beneficial.
            Being outside in the nature can boost your mental health, keeping you from stress and,
            calms your mind, and it can also lead to a lower risk of depression! We recommend 
            going for a hike when the weather is perfect!

            Watching movies is an alternative activity when you don't feel like going outside. Nothing 
            can get more comfortable than sitting with your family to watch a movie! We offer thousands
            of movies in our page, and of course we have movies for every mood! Watching a movie from 
            home means that you will have a lot more options than going out to the cinema.
